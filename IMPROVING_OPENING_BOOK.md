# How to Get Better Opening Book Answers

## Current Status (Gen30 - 30K games)

‚úÖ **What we have:**
- 48,093 positions explored (all within first 6 moves)
- 3.74 avg visits per position
- All 54 opening moves explored
- 32 moves with high confidence (500+ visits)
- Player 1 win rate: ~18% (discovered P2 advantage)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation:**
- Win rates very close together (17-19% range)
- Hard to distinguish which moves are ACTUALLY better
- Only 1-2% difference between "best" and "worst" moves

## Strategies to Get Better Answers

### üéØ Strategy 1: Continue Training (Gen30 ‚Üí Gen60+)
**Goal:** Get more visits per position to increase confidence

**How:**
- Continue from Gen30 policy for another 30-60 generations
- Keep exploration at 0.0001 (pure exploitation)
- Focus visits on the already-discovered positions

**Expected Results:**
- Gen60 (60K games): ~55K positions, 6-8 avg visits
- Gen100 (100K games): ~65K positions, 10-15 avg visits
- Win rate differences will become more statistically significant

**Effort:** Low (just run more training)
**Time:** 2-5 minutes
**Benefit:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High confidence in existing moves

**Do this:**
```javascript
// In run_phase2.html, load Gen30 policy and continue for 30+ more generations
Import policy: hexuki_policy_phase2_gen15_1760884573280.json
Generations: 30-60 more
Exploration: 0.0001 (fixed)
```

### üéØ Strategy 2: Reduce to First 4 Moves (8 ply total)
**Goal:** Focus learning on fewer positions for deeper understanding

**How:**
- Change maxMoveToLearn from 6 to 4
- This reduces search space by ~80%
- More visits concentrated on critical early game

**Expected Results:**
- ~5,000-8,000 positions instead of 48K
- 15-20 avg visits per position
- Much clearer win rate differences (20-30% range possible)

**Effort:** Low (just change config)
**Time:** 5 minutes for Gen30
**Benefit:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Very high confidence, but narrower scope

**Do this:**
```javascript
// In hexuki_ai_trainer.js, line ~35
this.maxMoveToLearn = 4;  // Changed from 6
```

### üéØ Strategy 3: Train Against Stronger Opponent Mix
**Goal:** Learn against varied opponents to find robust openings

**Current mix:** 60% self-play, 40% random

**Better mix options:**

**Option A: Pure Self-Play**
```javascript
mode: {self: 1.0, random: 0}
```
- Learns optimal play vs optimal defense
- Win rates will be more meaningful
- Current 60/40 mix dilutes learning with random noise

**Option B: Graduated Opponent Strength**
```javascript
// Early gens: Learn basics vs random
Gen 1-10: {self: 0.3, random: 0.7}

// Mid gens: Balanced learning
Gen 11-20: {self: 0.6, random: 0.4}

// Late gens: Pure optimization
Gen 21-50: {self: 1.0, random: 0}
```

**Effort:** Medium (requires custom schedule)
**Time:** Same as normal training
**Benefit:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê More meaningful win rates

### üéØ Strategy 4: Analyze Opening Responses (2-Move Sequences)
**Goal:** Understand not just P1's opening, but P2's best responses

**How:**
- Extract positions after P1's move + P2's response
- See which P1 openings lead to best P2 counter-play
- Find opening sequences, not just single moves

**Expected Results:**
- "If P1 plays t2h7, then P2 should play t8h12" type insights
- Understanding of opening trees
- Better strategic understanding

**Effort:** Medium (needs new analysis script)
**Time:** 10 minutes to write, instant to run
**Benefit:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Much deeper strategic insight

**I can build this for you!**

### üéØ Strategy 5: Train Separate Policies for P1 and P2
**Goal:** Specialize learning for each player's role

**How:**
- Train one policy that only learns P1 moves (odd moves: 1, 3, 5...)
- Train another policy that only learns P2 moves (even moves: 2, 4, 6...)
- This doubles the effective visits per position

**Expected Results:**
- P1 policy: Focused on attacking from disadvantage
- P2 policy: Focused on defensive counter-play
- Each position gets 2x visits in same training time

**Effort:** High (requires code changes)
**Time:** 1 hour to implement + 5 min training
**Benefit:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Specialized strategies per role

---

### üéØ Strategy 6: Evaluate Win Rate Spread (Statistical Analysis)
**Goal:** Determine if current differences are statistically significant

**How:**
- Calculate confidence intervals for each move
- Identify which moves are PROVABLY better
- Filter out moves with overlapping confidence intervals

**Expected Results:**
- "t2h7 is significantly better than t5h11 (p < 0.05)"
- Clear tier list of opening moves
- Understanding of which moves need more data

**Effort:** Low (analysis script)
**Time:** 10 minutes to write
**Benefit:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Know what you actually know

**I can build this for you!**

### üéØ Strategy 7: Test Against Baseline
**Goal:** Validate that opening book actually helps

**How:**
- Test Gen30 policy vs pure random player
- Test Gen30 policy vs Gen1 policy (untrained)
- Measure actual performance improvement

**Expected Results:**
- "Opening book improves P1 win rate from 15% to 19%"
- Quantify the value of the opening book
- Identify which phase of game matters more

**Effort:** Low (use existing test harness)
**Time:** 1-2 minutes per test
**Benefit:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Proves the value

**I can run this for you!**

## What Will Give You the Best Answer?

**For highest confidence in single opening moves:**
‚Üí Continue to Gen60-100 (more visits)

**For understanding opening strategy:**
‚Üí 2-move sequence analysis (see the responses)

**For deepest opening knowledge:**
‚Üí maxMoveToLearn=4 with Gen50 training

**For proving it works:**
‚Üí Test vs random baseline

## My Recommendation

**Do these 3 things in order:**

1. **Continue training to Gen60** (3 minutes)
   - This will clarify if t2h7 (19.2% WR) is ACTUALLY better than t1h7 (18.9%)
   - With 6-8 visits per position, statistical significance emerges

2. **Build 2-move sequence analyzer** (I do this, 10 min)
   - See "If P1 plays X, what does P2 play, and who wins"
   - Much more strategic insight than single moves

3. **Statistical significance test** (I do this, 10 min)
   - Get tier list: "Proven good" vs "Needs more data" vs "Proven bad"
   - Know what you actually know

**Total time:** 25 minutes for dramatically better answers!
