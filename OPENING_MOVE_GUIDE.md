# Opening Move Guide - What Your AI Learned

## 🎮 Game Setup

**Starting Position**: Tile 1 is placed at Hex 9 (center) by Player 2
**First Move**: Player 1 must respond

## 🗺️ Hex Board Layout

```
CORRECT Hexuki Board (19 hexes):

         0
       1     2
     3     4     5
   6     7
 8    [9]   10
  11    12
    13    14    15
      16    17
        18

Center = Hex 9 (starts with Tile 1, owned by P2)
```

**Hex 9 (center) neighbors**: 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14 (all directly adjacent)

## 🎯 AI's First Move Recommendations

### **BEST Opening Moves** (Player 1's First Move)

Based on 50,000 games of training:

| Rank | Move | Visits | Win Rate | Confidence | Recommendation |
|------|------|--------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Tile 1 → Hex 12** | 9,001 | 42.4% | ⭐⭐⭐ | **Most Explored** |
| 2 | **Tile 9 → Hex 11** | 4,148 | 40.1% | ⭐⭐ | Strong option |
| 3 | **Tile 8 → Hex 11** | 3,729 | 39.7% | ⭐⭐ | Strong option |
| 4 | **Tile 2 → Hex 12** | 3,522 | 39.5% | ⭐⭐ | Strong option |
| 5 | **Tile 7 → Hex 11** | 2,827 | 38.6% | ⭐⭐ | Good option |

**Analysis**:
- **Most popular**: Tile 1 → Hex 12 (9,001 visits!)
- **Best positions**: Hex 11 or Hex 12 (outer ring, lower side)
- **Best tiles**: Low tiles (1, 2, 7, 8, 9) for opening

### **Visual Recommendation**:

```
         0
       1     2
     3     4     5
   6     7
 8    [9]   10
  11    12 ← BEST! (Tile 1)
    13    14    15
      16    17
        18
```

**AI's Opening Strategy**:
1. **First choice**: Hex 12 with Tile 1 (42.4% WR, 9,001 visits)
2. **Second choice**: Hex 11 with Tile 8 or 9 (40% WR, 3,700-4,100 visits)
3. **Avoid**: HIGH tiles (5-9) at Hex 7 on first move (0% WR!)

## ❌ WORST Opening Moves (NEVER DO THIS!)

| Move | Visits | Win Rate | Result |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| **ANY tile → Hex 7** | 105 each | **0.0%** | 💀 **INSTANT LOSS!** |
| Tile 5 → Hex 7 | 105 | 0.0% | ❌ |
| Tile 6 → Hex 7 | 105 | 0.0% | ❌ |
| Tile 7 → Hex 7 | 105 | 0.0% | ❌ |
| Tile 8 → Hex 7 | 105 | 0.0% | ❌ |
| Tile 9 → Hex 7 | 105 | 0.0% | ❌ |

**Hex 7 = Death Trap!** 💀

```
       0   1   2
      3   4   5   6
     7 ← 💀 NEVER!
      8  [9]  10  11
      12  13  14  15
       16  17  18
```

**Why Hex 7 is terrible**:
- Too far from center (Hex 9)
- Hard to form chains
- Gets isolated easily
- AI learned this after 105 attempts = 0 wins!

## 🎓 Pattern Analysis

### Hex Position Strategy

**Good Opening Hexes** (based on visits and win rate):

1. **Hex 12**: 15,983 total visits across all tiles (most popular!)
   - Bottom-left outer position
   - Good for chain building
   - Best with Tile 1 (42.4% WR)

2. **Hex 11**: 11,533 total visits
   - Right outer position
   - Good connectivity
   - Best with Tile 8 or 9 (~40% WR)

3. **Hex 4**: 2,096 visits
   - Inner ring, left side
   - Decent fallback option

**Bad Opening Hexes**:

1. **Hex 7**: 0% win rate with ANY tile! 💀
2. **Hex 17**: Sometimes 100% WR in later moves, but not as opener

### Tile Selection Strategy

**Best Opening Tiles** (for first move):

1. **Tile 1**: Most versatile (42% WR at Hex 12)
2. **Tile 8-9**: High tiles work well at Hex 11 (40% WR)
3. **Tile 2**: Decent backup (39% WR at Hex 12)
4. **Tile 7**: Good option (38% WR at Hex 11)

**Avoid as Openers**:
- Tile 4: Only 33.6% WR
- Tile 5-6: Very low success rates

### **Killer Moves** (Found in positions after first move)

These moves have **100% or near-100% win rates** in specific game states:

| Move | Visits | Win Rate | Context |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Tile 1 → Hex 8** | 558 | **100.0%** | Inner ring dominance |
| **Tile 2 → Hex 8** | 558 | **100.0%** | Inner ring control |
| **Tile 1 → Hex 17** | 2,402 | **95.0%** | 🔥 **KILLER MOVE!** |
| **Tile 1 → Hex 14** | 932 | **90.3%** | 🔥 **STRONG MOVE!** |
| **Tile 2 → Hex 14** | 823 | **88.6%** | ⭐ Powerful |

**Hex 17 Pattern** (95% win rate!):
```
       0   1   2
      3   4   5   6
     7   8  [9]  10  11
      12  13  14  15
       16  17← 🔥 KILLER!
           18
```

**When to use**: After establishing position at Hex 11 or 12, playing Tile 1 at Hex 17 is devastating!

## 📊 Opening Repertoire Summary

### **Recommended Opening Book** (First 3 Moves)

#### **Move 1 (Player 1)**:
- **Primary**: Tile 1 → Hex 12 (42.4% WR, 9001 visits)
- **Alternative**: Tile 9 → Hex 11 (40.1% WR, 4148 visits)
- **Alternative**: Tile 8 → Hex 11 (39.7% WR, 3729 visits)

#### **Move 2 (Player 2 Response)**:
- Depends on P1's choice
- AI likely mirrors: If P1 plays Hex 12, P2 might play Hex 11 or nearby

#### **Move 3 (Player 1 Follow-up)**:
- Build chains from initial position
- Look for opportunities to play Hex 17 or Hex 14 (killer moves!)
- Avoid Hex 7 at all costs!

## 🎯 Strategic Principles Learned

From 50,000 games, the AI discovered:

### ✅ DO:
1. **Start at outer ring** (Hex 11, 12) for flexibility
2. **Use low tiles early** (1, 2) to save high tiles
3. **Aim for Hex 17** in mid-game (95% WR!)
4. **Control inner ring** (Hex 8 especially) when possible
5. **Build chains incrementally** (avoid big jumps)

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Never play Hex 7** on first move (0% WR)
2. **Don't waste high tiles** (8, 9) on weak positions
3. **Don't play isolated hexes** early
4. **Don't ignore chain constraints**
5. **Don't play randomly** - use learned patterns!

## 🎮 Practical Guide

### **If you're Player 1** (first to move):

**Best Opening Sequence**:
1. **Move 1**: Tile 1 → Hex 12 (most explored, solid choice)
2. **Move 3**: Build toward Hex 17 or Hex 14 (killer positions!)
3. **Move 5**: Establish chain dominance, avoid Hex 7

**Expected Outcome**: ~42% win rate from this position (better than 33% random)

### **If you're Player 2** (responding):

- **Counter** P1's Hex 12 with Hex 11 control
- **Mirror** strong positions
- **Avoid** Hex 7 completely
- **Look for** Hex 17 opportunities (95% WR!)
