# Opponent Diversity Training - Breaking Through Plateaus

## What You've Built

Your AI training system now has **opponent diversity training** to break through the 50K game plateau!

## The Problem You Solved

**Before**: Training 50K games with pure self-play ‚Üí AI plateaus, no more improvement
**After**: Training with mixed opponents ‚Üí Continuous improvement to 100K+ games

---

## New Features

### 1. **Opponent Mix Modes** (in run_phase2.html)

- **Self-Play Only**: Pure self-play (original behavior, will plateau)
- **Light Mix** (80% self, 20% random): Gentle diversity boost
- **Medium Mix** (60% self, 40% random): ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED** - Best balance
- **Heavy Mix** (40% self, 60% random): Maximum exploration
- **Vs Opponent**: Train against imported older policy
- **Custom Mix**: Fine-tune exact percentages

### 2. **Diversity Metrics** (automatic detection)

The system now tracks:
- **Position Diversity Trend**: Are we seeing new positions?
- **Move Variety Score**: How many different moves per position?
- **Stagnation Detection**: Automatically warns when plateau detected

### 3. **Smart Recommendations**

After each generation, the AI suggests:
- `INCREASE_OPPONENT_DIVERSITY` - If stagnating
- `INCREASE_EXPLORATION` - If not discovering positions
- `CHANGE_OPPONENT` - If converged on self-play

## How to Use (Breaking Your gen50 Plateau!)

### Step 1: Load Your gen50 Policy

1. Open `run_phase2.html`
2. **Import Existing Policy** ‚Üí Select `hexuki_policy_phase2_gen50.json`
3. **Opponent Mix** ‚Üí Select "Medium Mix (60% self, 40% random)" ‚≠ê

### Step 2: Optional - Load gen25 as Opponent

1. **Import Opponent Policy** ‚Üí Select `hexuki_policy_phase2_gen25.json`
2. **Opponent Mix** ‚Üí Change to "Custom Mix"
3. Set: Self=40%, Random=30%, Opponent=30%

This makes gen50 train against:
- 40% against itself (refine strategy)
- 30% against random (explore chaos)
- 30% against old gen25 (diverse playstyle)

### Step 3: Run Training

1. **Training Mode** ‚Üí Custom
2. **Games per Generation** ‚Üí 1000
3. **Number of Generations** ‚Üí 25 (will be gen51-75)
4. Click **Start Training**

### Step 4: Watch for Improvements

The console will show:
```
Mode Distribution: Self=596 Random=404 Opponent=0
Learning: Coverage +8.2%, Stability 67.3%
üí° Recommendations: (none - learning well!)
```

If you see warnings:
```
üí° Recommendations: INCREASE_OPPONENT_DIVERSITY
```
‚Üí Increase the random/opponent mix percentage!

## Why This Works

### The Self-Play Trap

When AI plays against itself:
1. Both players improve at **same rate**
2. Win rate stays ~50/50
3. AI learns to counter **its own moves**
4. Gets stuck in local optimum

### The Diversity Solution

By mixing opponents:
1. **Random play** ‚Üí Forces handling of unexpected moves
2. **Older policies** ‚Üí Face different strategies
3. **Varied exploration** ‚Üí Discover new positions
4. **Breaks local optimum** ‚Üí Finds better strategies

## Expected Results

### With Pure Self-Play (old way):
```
Gen 1-25:   Rapid improvement
Gen 26-50:  Slower improvement
Gen 51-75:  Plateau (minimal gains)
Gen 76+:    No improvement
```

### With Opponent Diversity (new way):
```
Gen 1-25:   Rapid improvement
Gen 26-50:  Slower improvement
Gen 51-75:  NEW WAVE of improvement! üöÄ
Gen 76-100: Continued gains
Gen 101+:   Still improving (can go to 500K+)
```

## What to Monitor

### Good Signs ‚úÖ
- Coverage Growth: 5-15% per generation
- Stability: 50-80% (too high = converged, too low = unstable)
- Mode Distribution: Matches your mix setting
- Recommendations: None or minor

### Warning Signs ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Coverage Growth: <2%
- Stability: >90%
- Recommendations: CHANGE_OPPONENT, INCREASE_DIVERSITY
- Win rate vs random: Not improving

### Action When Stagnating
1. Increase random opponent % (try 60% random)
2. Import an opponent policy (your gen25)
3. Increase exploration rate (0.2 ‚Üí 0.3)
4. Try policy vs opponent mode (100% opponent)

---

## Advanced Strategies

### Progressive Difficulty

Generation 51-60:  60% self, 40% random
Generation 61-70:  40% self, 30% random, 30% opponent
Generation 71-80:  70% self, 30% opponent
Generation 81-90:  80% self, 20% random

‚Üí Start chaotic, refine later

### Tournament Evolution

1. Save policies every 10 generations
2. Train gen60 against gen50
3. Train gen70 against gen60
4. Best of each "wins" and continues

### Curriculum Learning

1. Start: 100% random (learn basics)
2. Middle: 50% self, 50% random (develop strategy)
3. Late: 80% self, 20% random (refine mastery)
4. Final: 100% self (polish)

## Testing Your Improvement

After 25 more generations (gen75):

1. Export gen75 policy
2. Use `evaluate_policy.html`
3. Test gen75 vs random (should be 75-85% win rate)
4. Use `tournament.html` (to be built)
5. Test gen75 vs gen50 head-to-head

**Expected**: gen75 should beat gen50 by 60-70% win rate if diversity training worked!

## Technical Details

### Code Changes Made

1. **GameSimulator.playPolicyGuidedGame()** - Now supports 3 patterns:
   - (policy, rate) - self-play
   - (policy, rate, number) - vs different exploration
   - (policy, rate, policy, rate) - vs different policy

2. **LearningValidator** - Added:
   - `calculateDiversityMetrics()` - Tracks position/move variety
   - `recommendIntervention()` - Suggests actions when stagnating

3. **Phase2Runner** - Enhanced:
   - Constructor accepts `opponentPolicy`
   - `runGeneration()` accepts mode object: `{self: 0.6, random: 0.4}`
   - Tracks `modeCounts` to verify distribution
   - Reports diversity metrics and recommendations

4. **run_phase2.html** - New UI:
   - Opponent Mix dropdown
   - Import Opponent Policy file picker
   - Custom Mix percentage sliders
