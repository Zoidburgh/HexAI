# Strategic Insights from Gen20 Policy - First 2 Moves

## Move 1 (Opening) - Player 1's First Move

### Starting Position
- Player 2 has a piece at **hex 9** (center of board)
- Player 1 must place their first piece

### Board Layout
```
     0  1  2
   3  4  5  6
 7  8  9 10 11
  12 13 14 15
    16 17 18
```

## Key Strategic Findings

### 1. BEST OPENING MOVE: **t1h7** (54.7% WR)
- **Tile 1, Hex 7** - Far from center (distance 2.0)
- Played 1,074 times (most explored)
- Significantly outperforms other moves
- **Strategic value**: Position 7 is on the left edge, diagonal from center

### 2. HEX POSITION MATTERS MORE THAN TILE NUMBER

**Best Hex Positions:**
- **Hex 7**: 46.6% avg WR (4,646 games) - LEFT EDGE, diagonal from center
- **Hex 12**: 48.2% avg WR (4,505 games) - BOTTOM LEFT, near center
- **Hex 14**: 47.2% avg WR (4,266 games) - BOTTOM RIGHT, near center

**Worst Hex Positions:**
- **Hex 11**: 32.5% avg WR (1,625 games) - RIGHT EDGE (opposite strategy!)
- **Hex 6**: 38.0% avg WR (2,056 games) - TOP RIGHT

**Critical Pattern**: Hex 7 beats Hex 11 by **14 percentage points!**
- Both are equal distance from center (2.0)
- Both are edge positions
- **Hex 7 (left) dominates, Hex 11 (right) fails**

### 3. DISTANCE STRATEGY

**Adjacent to center (<= 1.5 distance):**
- Average WR: 43.9%
- 36 different moves
- 13,729 total games

**Far from center (1.5-3.0 distance):**
- Average WR: 39.6%
- 18 different moves
- 6,271 total games

**Finding**: Staying adjacent is slightly better on average, BUT the single best move (t1h7) is FAR from center!

### 4. TILE NUMBERS (tiles 1-9)

**Tile performance is remarkably UNIFORM:**
- Tile 1-8: 42-44% average WR (very similar)
- Tile 9: 38.7% average WR (noticeably worse)

**Conclusion**: **WHERE** you place matters far more than **WHAT** tile you place.

## Move 2 - Player 2's Response to t1h7

### Position after t1h7:
- Player 1: Tile 1 at hex 7 (left edge)
- Player 2: Starting piece at hex 9 (center)

### Best Responses (Player 2's perspective - HIGH WR = P2 WINS)

**Top 5 Responses:**
1. **t9h10** (74.4% WR) - Hex 10, adjacent to own piece (distance from P2: 1.0)
2. **t7h2** (65.7% WR) - Hex 2, far from both pieces
3. **t8h4** (64.5% WR) - Hex 4, equidistant from both pieces (1.4, 1.4)
4. **t9h2** (63.3% WR) - Hex 2, far from both pieces
5. **t8h2** (62.1% WR) - Hex 2, far from both pieces

### Strategic Patterns for Move 2:

**Attacking P1 piece (close to hex 7):**
- Average WR: 38.2%
- Total games: 343
- **POOR STRATEGY** - Loses more often

**Defending P2 piece (close to hex 9):**
- Average WR: 38.3%
- Total games: 851
- **ALSO POOR** - Roughly equal to attacking

**Neutral positions (far from both):**
- Average WR: 51.7%
- Total games: 223
- **BEST STRATEGY** - Avoid engagement!

### Critical Insight for Move 2:
**The best response is NOT to defend or attack, but to establish position elsewhere on the board!**

Specifically:
- **t9h10**: Adjacent to own piece but AWAY from opponent = 74.4% WR
- **Hex 2 moves**: Far corner, maximum distance from engagement = 62-66% WR

## Overall Strategic Conclusions

### 1. **Spatial Dominance Patterns**
The game shows clear **positional asymmetry**:
- Left side (hex 7, 12) favors Player 1
- Right side (hex 11) is weak
- This suggests the game may have **directional goals** (e.g., connecting left-to-right or top-to-bottom)

### 2. **Engagement Strategy**
- **Move 1**: Player 1 should play FAR from center (t1h7 on left edge)
- **Move 2**: Player 2 should AVOID direct confrontation, expand territory instead

### 3. **Tile Numbers Are Overrated**
- Tiles 1-8 perform almost identically (42-44% avg)
- Only Tile 9 is notably weaker (38.7%)
- **Position selection >>> Tile selection**

### 4. **The "t1h7 Opening" is Dominant**
With 54.7% win rate and 1,074 games played:
- This is a **statistically significant** advantage
- Player 1 has a first-move advantage IF they play correctly
- Player 2 can equalize with proper response (t9h10 recovers to 74.4% from P2 perspective)

### 5. **Game Balance Assessment**
- Opening position shows slight Player 1 advantage (best moves are 54.7%)
- Player 2 can counter effectively (74.4% recovery)
- **Overall game appears well-balanced** with proper play from both sides

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

1. **Test if hex 7 advantage persists** beyond Move 1
2. **Analyze why hex 11 (right edge) is so weak** - may reveal game mechanics
3. **Study tile 9's poor performance** - is it weaker tiles, or position correlation?
4. **Examine if the game has directional winning conditions** (left-right connectivity?)
5. **Increase data for moves 3-4** to see if early patterns persist

---

## Data Reliability

**Move 1**: ✅ Excellent (103-1,074 games per move)
**Move 2**: ✅ Good (12-39 games per move in best line)

These conclusions are statistically robust for the opening 2 moves.
